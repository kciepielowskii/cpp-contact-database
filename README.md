# Dynamic Contact Database (C++)

A lightweight console-based application designed to manage a contact list. This project serves as a demonstration of fundamental C++ concepts, specifically focusing on manual memory management on the heap.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Manual Memory Allocation**: Direct use of `new[]` and `delete[]` operators.
- **Dynamic Array Resizing**: The database automatically increases its capacity by 10 slots whenever the limit is reached.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Logic for adding, viewing, and deleting contacts with efficient data handling.
- **Pointer Optimization**: Efficiently passes data using pointers and constant references to minimize memory overhead.

## 🛠 Technical Details
- **Memory Safety**: Implements deep copying during reallocation to ensure data integrity and prevent memory leaks.
- **Element Shifting**: When a record is deleted, subsequent elements are shifted left to maintain a contiguous array without gaps.



## 📖 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o database
